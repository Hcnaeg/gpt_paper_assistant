1. Paper discussing improvements in recommendation systems using Large Language Models (LLM):
    - Relevant: Applying LLM to a specific aspect of recommendation systems, such as feature enhancement, and achieving significant progress.
    - Not relevant: Papers that have no involvement with LLM.
2. Paper exploring the combination of text information and collaborative signals in recommendation systems:
    - Relevant: Designing a method, for example, an adapter network structure, to adapt the representation of text information to recommendation tasks.
    - Not relevant: Papers that do not involve textual information and only discuss ID-based recommendation methods.
3. Paper addressing the correction of illusionary issues in large models:
    - Relevant: Designing a method to reduce factual errors in LLM responses.
    - Not relevant: Papers that do not involve LLM or do not discuss illusionary issues in LLM.
4. Papers improving the efficiency of large model inference
5. Papers related to knowledge-editing techniques:
    - Relevant: Designing a method to update knowledge stored in LLM or injecting external knowledge into LLM.
    - Not relevant: Papers that do not involve LLM or do not address knowledge updates in LLM.
6. Papers combining Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Graph Neural Network (GNN) technologies:
    - Relevant: Designing a method to inject semantic information into GNN, such as initializing GNN nodes with embeddings produced by language models; discussing related work on Text Attribute Graphs (TAG).
    - Not relevant: Papers that do not involve NLP techniques or do not deal with graph-format data.
